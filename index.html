                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    No Pressure’s self-titled is a masterclass in modern pop-punk. Taking influence dating back 30 years. Parker Cannon, the frontman, is no stranger to this genre. His first contribution to this society of anxiety was in his band The Story So Far, who are widely considered legends of the Emo world. Of course, the subculture of emo is directly fueled by pop-punk, like bread and butter. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This album is a great example of consistency within a band’s sound. Many would complain about how this albums tracks begin to blend into each other, however if you listen closely enough you begin to hear the nuance, a calculated risk by these punk veterans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Songs such as “Lock it Up” and “Both Sides” are heavy, rhythmic, and sure to make you dance. The track list seems acts as a recital for these players, showing off an educated, and mature sound. It is no question this album could not be written by just any rookie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you like today’s hardcore scene, the returning emo sound, or the old stuff, No Pressure is undoubtedly the refreshing mix you are searching for. I personally was worried that due to the other great pop-punk albums we have reviewed this month that this one wouldn’t hold a high torch to its siblings, but I was pleasantly proven wrong, these pop-punk professors are no joke, and have come to play.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Parker Cannon… As if this pop punk project from 2022 couldn’t get any cooler… Parker Cannon is the spearhead of the LP?! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have listened to his popular emo group “The Story So Far”, you might be able to pick up that distinct voice he holds, and combined with the skate-punk guitar hooks and stellar bass riffs, you have a group that rips through 10 tracks at lightning speed. It’s apparent he took the emo punk energy he is so familiar with, and translated it toward this genre, something you can hear in tracks like “Big Man” with its moody vocal melody. The group also includes Light Year’s Pat Kennedy on the Guitars, and Regulate’s Harry Corrigan on the drums, helping to support the skater/hardcore roots they built the project on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backbone of this album really comes from its strings and drums (obviously), and it's not in the way that The Offspring uses heavy riffs to support their tracks, but really in its consistent use of clear toned, fast riffs, matched with interesting drum patterns, making it all the more fun to listen to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since listening to their 2020 EP, No Pressure captivated me. It took my love of emo and combined it with my love of punk to produce one of my favorite albums I've listened to this year. And now after having researched the band, it all makes sense, cause what emo loving person wouldn’t love the incredible vocals Parker Cannon has graced the rock scene with for the last two decades. The Story So Far is currently on their electric Fall tour, and in the Spring, Cannon will front a supporting tour for Drain, and if they can bring the high octane energy of this album to the stage, it will be the punk act of the season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So slip on your Vans and jump around your room to the beat of No Pressure’s self titled LP, letting every beautiful guitar lick hit your ears with the ferocity brought on by years of experience in the industry.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
