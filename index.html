                <p>
                    The final day of 31 days of punk! Before we get into the album, I want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to read our blog. Whether it was just one day or all 31, it means the world that you would take the time to consider what we have to say. Okay now time for the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Formed in 1983, Scottish post-punk band The Jesus and Mary Chain are one of the most influential alternative acts of all time. Their use of static, low-fidelity tone effects with high reverb vocals create these absolutely serene soundscapes. What separated them from the ethereal dream-pop and synthwave bands of the time was their edgy aesthetic, all derived from the European punk bands of their youth. Their concerts became wargrounds, with fans tearing down halls while experiencing the tremendous sound of The JAMC. By the late 80’s there was nothing stopping this band.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Psychocandy, this band’s third studio album, is an absolute hallmark of noisy, synth driven punk. Brother Jim and William Reid had evolved their sound after years of touring and were ready to create a masterpiece. They did this in a few ways. One was innovating their instrumentals by employing new wave effects credited to bands like Souixie and The Banshees. The other was within their musical storytelling. For example, one of my favorite songs of all time is the opening track “Just Like Honey,” and until I listened to the album in full I never got why a slow love song like that was a record opener. However, once you hear the late track “Sowing Seeds” you realize that their shared melody is in fact a motif. Funny enough there was another group that did this all the time, Mazzy Star. No wonder, Hope Sandoval was a great friend of this band, and helped record their first smash hit “Sometimes Always.” Unsurprisingly, you can also hear the classic rock influences such as the Monkees within this albums chord progression, a great example being the song “Never Understand” which might as well be a blenderized beach boys tune. This album, beyond its musical genius, has its influences within popular culture. You can see this album referenced in movies like “Lost in Translation,” “500 Days of Summer,” and “High Fidelity.” Modern songwriter Phoebe Bridgers brought out the band for her Glastonbury set just a couple of years ago too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Psychocandy is one of my favorite albums ever recorded. It is genre defining, rule-breaking, and audio-bliss. Between trashing their equipment to worrying about feedback, this band took accidents, and made them art. If The Jesus and Mary Chain were not already legends, this album skyrocketed them there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I hope this month has taught you something, not just about this amazing genre, but also about people. Our unprogrammed ability to defy odds and break rules, that's punk. And it is art because it is inherently human. I hope this blog has proved to you that we are more connected than what meets the eye. And if nothing else, you have found something to add to your playlist. Thanks y’all.

                <p>
                    Sadly, it’s the last day of the month, but in this long December we have covered everything from the old American punk tunes of MC5 to the modern day rock idols of, well, The Idles, and personally, it gave me 31 opportunities to continue falling in love with the genre I adore. Today, Benjamin and I are ending the month with a special treat, an interesting flavor of punk and practically the alternative bible, The Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Psychocandy”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Love, sex, and drugs are the first 3 words that come up when you look up the context of The JAMC’s lyrics, loosely summing up this duo of 80s alternative flare out of Scotland that became the foundation of Shoegaze and melodic rock. Some may not refer to The JAMC as punk, and I wouldn’t blame them, cause how could you pigeonhole such a wideranging band. They take the post punk feel of standout artists like Billy Idol and Joy Division, fusing it with their aggressive, as much as melodic keys and guitars. Put together, they achieved a sound that won awards, incited riots, and lured fans from all over the world. Their debut studio album traded the loud screams of 70s punk for a more mellow feel, and it makes this album all the better, getting emotional vocals not rooted in anger or frustration, but rather in sincerity, if that makes any sense. All in all, it just works, whether that be the strange blend it has with the distorted guitar or how the soundscape builds throughout the record, it all works together in a way that solidified The Jesus and Mary Chain in punk, indie, alternative, and music glory.
                </p>

                  Ever so often in my 21 years on this earth, comes an album I instantly connect with, and everything about it I fall in love with from the first track on. “Psychocandy” is one of them. Until today I had only ever heard one The JAMC song, “Sometimes Always”, the duet with Hope Sandoval (incredible song). But from the first few words of “Just Like Honey” I was transported into a state of music heaven, with confidence there would be no song matching it for the rest of the album, and to my pleasant surprise, every track on the album had its own distinct strengths. Something that really shapes this album is how great its soundscape was, which given they were pioneers in shoegaze, it was no surprise their use of distortion pedals to create these beautiful tones that amplified their already talented instumentals. It’s an album made to listen in any format, but if you can I strongly suggest headphones or earbuds to get the full experience. I don’t know, I am just obsessed with it, and it’s albums like this that remind me of why I enjoy this genre and all of the new and interesting sub-genres that have come around because of it. It’s fun, it’s endearing, and it’s fascinating to say the least.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For all the lovers, the rockers, the rebels, and the music enjoyers, The Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Psychocandy” is the perfect gem for any collection, and proves that punk doesn’t have to be just noise for the sake of noise. What an incredible record to end the blog with. Thank you for listening along.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
