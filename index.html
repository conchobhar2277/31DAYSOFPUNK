                <p>
                    WILD IN THE STREETS! I have been awaiting the day that we get to talk about The Circle Jerks. Jumping into the west coast scene around the late 70’s, they quickly made a name for themselves playing in circuits around Los Angeles with the other up and coming punk acts, including a band called The Germs, a band that happened to include rock legend Pat Smear (Nirvana, Foo Fighters). Speaking of legendary punk bands, one of the founding members of The Circle Jerks, Keith Morris, was once part of the early hardcore group Black Flag (stay tuned)
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time 1982 swung around, these cats had already established themselves as the counterculture kings of California, and with no sign of stopping they released “Wild in the Streets.” A 15 track explosive runaround targeting the elite and arrogant. The Circle Jerks were far from political ambiguity. Before diving into their charged lyrics they make their views crystal clear with titles like “Question Authority” and “Political Stu.” The title track “Wild in the Streets” is a riot anthem dedicated to the power of civilian action, and the ignorance of the federal government - Mrs. America, how’s your favorite son? Do you care just what he’s done? - This band never cared about commercial popularity, so much so that they intentionally named themselves The Circle Jerks so that they couldn’t be played on lead radio stations. What really makes this album special is its ending, which is an outstanding rendition of Jackie DeShannon’s “Put a Little Love In Your Heart,” a perfect example of how placing a song's lyrics into a different context can bring a whole new texture to its meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Circle Jerks would continue to hold a long standing career, with four more albums up until 1995, and since then have continued touring the world. They have on occasion taken a brief hiatus, as Greg Hetson focussed on his other widely successful band, Bad Religion. While we do not know if/when there will be another Circle Jerks project, we do know that their impact stays relevant enough, put a little love in your heart folks.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                   Circle Jerks. What a name. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If anarchy and urban revolution could be balled up, smashed, and thrown into a thrashing 15 track LP, “Wild in the Streets” would be it. It’s no coincidence this month has been filled with the soundtrack of skaters around the globe, and Circle Jerks are no stranger to the scene, with fans ranging from your favorite celebrities, to the kid down the street fishing through his Dad’s old CDs. And how could you blame the kid, because who wouldn’t love a band fronted by a guy who rocked out with Black Flag before forming what would go down as one of the greatest hardcore punk groups out of LA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their second album, “Wild in the Streets” is an honest love letter to the underbelly rampage caused by the youth growing up in LA, and more than just that, it is a testament to surviving in an urban landscape, struggles with authority, and cutting your teeth on whatever hand life dealt you. To get their message across, they threw away the dramatic nonsense and focused on telling the audience exactly what they meant, with some of highlights being “Don’t come down on me, you’re an educated jerk” and “The world’s our dowery, the glory and the power. This is what you want to see, is this the way you want things to be”. It’s not a style invented by Circle Jerks, nor was it the last time an artist was so cut and dry with their listeners, but they sure used it to advance their message to as wide an audience as possible, even if that was just the early 80s angsty young adults of Los Angeles. Each song is a roller coaster of raw guitar riffs and bass lines combined with the simple yet powerful drum patterns, it creates a listening experience fit for any size mosh pit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still can’t get over the amazing cover of “Put a Little Love in Your Heart” at the end of the record. This album has so much flare and so much spunk, I loved it end to end. It scratches the hardcore punk itch I crave so frequently, and its multitude of themes and musical range make it easy for anyone to find a track they enjoy, punk rock fan or not. With such an infamous stage presence and especially in entertainment city, it’s no wonder this sophomore album went on to enthrall and inspire rock greats such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s raw punk energy straight from the 80s, baptized in the blood, sweat, and tears of the LA underground scene, Circle Jerks “Wild in the Streets” is a riot waiting to happen in your headphones, so go listen to it.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
