                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                   The all-powerful Minor Threat only released two albums and a couple EPs, making them one of the smallest discographies on this list. This album, “First Two Seven Inches” is a compilation album released in 1984. An A+ report of the band's short career. Similar to this band's punk brothers and sisters, there is never a point where vocalist Ian Mackaye lowers past his decibel level. The band backing him returns this powerful energy by ripping apart their instruments every night. While these heathens never played in a room above 500 people, their legacy has hit thousands. 
                    Some of the standout tracks from this album include “ Straight Edge,” “In My Eyes,” and their title track “Minor Threat.” All of which are tunes laced in political, emotional, and violent lyrics. The song I really want to highlight is Steppin’ Stone, which appears as an original on this album. The song is a perfect example of what intentional mixing looks like. The song begins very Lo-Fi, and as it progresses it crescendos into its booming high fidelity that we have gotten used to. This effect makes you feel as though you are standing outside a club, and as the crowd bursts into a mosh pit you enter, witnessing the full force of these punk behemoths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned previously, the impressive legacy of this band cannot be overstated. Countless of your favorite rock bands take direct inspiration from Minor Threat. Foo Fighters have recorded a great cover of their song “I Don’t Wanna Hear It.” And with all those musicians coming from the city punk scene of the 80’s, it is no wonder that they praise such legends. When listening to this record you might think to yourself “wow, these guys sound a lot like a band I know.” Yes, your intuition was correct. The rock band who made tidal waves this year, Turnstile, share a similar sound and cadence, about 40 years apart. This is also unsurprising as Minor Threat was from D.C. and Turnstile calls Baltimore, a city just a few miles down the road, their home. But whether you like them because of their sound, their in your face energy, or their uncensored messaging, Minor Threat was the candle in the wind that we wish would ignite again.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
