                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    “Brothers, it's time to testify, 
                    and I want to know, are you ready to testify? 
                    Are you ready? I give you a testimonial: the MC5!” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most essential bands to the formation 
                    of punk music, MC5 (Motor City 5), released 
                    their live album “Kick Out The Jams” in 1969. 
                    It is difficult to convey just how powerful 
                    this record is. It is not until you hear the 
                    powerful opening speech (quoted above) running 
                    straight into their song “Ramblin’ Rose” that 
                    you feel your bones shake by the intensity of 
                    their performance. You might as well be in that 
                    sweaty boiler room yourself. Detroit, known 
                    initially for the creation of Motown, birthed 
                    this band in the early 60’s, and with the boom 
                    of Rob Tyner’s voice, punk was in the motor city. 
                    In fact, MC5 to some is considered the first U.S. 
                    punk band period, and while that fact is up for 
                    debate, what we know for certain is that a lot of 
                    our favorite bands would not be the same without 
                    MC5. For instance, when I listen to Kick Out The 
                    Jams I hear the future sounds of KISS (MC5 would 
                    have a direct influence on their hit song 
                    “Detroit Rock City”). Bob Seger, the 
                    infamous Detroit rocker, was gaining 
                    traction at the same time these cats were, 
                    and their infectious energy certainly rubbed 
                    off on him. One of the biggest names in 
                    Rock & Roll, Jack White, would follow in the 
                    footsteps of his ancestors when forming the 
                    legendary White Stripes. So whether you are 
                    familiar with this band or not, you can thank 
                    them for their influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the album MC5 honors Detroit blues 
                    legend John Lee Hooker with the song 
                    “Motor City is Burning” opening the 
                    tune by exclaiming “Brothers and sisters, 
                    I wanna tell you something - I hear a 
                    lot of talk from a lot of honkeys, sitting 
                    on a lot of money, saying they're the high 
                    society. But if you ask me, this is the high 
                    society, this is the high society!” Many 
                    bands of this era were warned to not push 
                    their political opinions onto their records 
                    as it would effectively kill their radio 
                    potential and prove bad for business. 
                    But in true punk nature, MC5 did not care, 
                    they would rather celebrate the real 
                    people of the world than put more 
                    money into the pockets of millionaires. 
                    This group stood as a rallying cry for 
                    social change, recognizing that the 
                    true problem may be between class 
                    rather than between race and gender. 
                    In the history of punk, rock & roll, 
                    and rioting, they are seen as heroes. 
                    And while the final member passed 
                    just a few years ago, 
                    their legacy still remains as 
                    relevant as ever. MC5 IS ALIVE!

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s the 5th album of the month and 
                    you know what time it is? It's time to 
                    KICK OUT THE JAMS!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Motor City 5 aka MC5 was a band screaming 
                    out of Lincoln Park Michigan, formed in the 
                    same way lots of great rock bands were, as a 
                    high school combo with a lot to say. From 
                    those very first few words “are you ready 
                    to testify” followed by that crazy rock and 
                    roll tone you always knew you loved, 
                    it couldn’t be clearer that MC5 was the 
                    hammer that carved the title “Detroit Rock City”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honestly and truly if I could go back 24 hours 
                    and listen to this album again for the first 
                    time, I would do it 3 times over. It’s one of 
                    those records that just makes you want to move 
                    in all directions and replay each track before 
                    it even ends. Kick out the Jams is a spectrum 
                    of anything and everything you could want in a 
                    punk album. It has psychedelic rock about desire, 
                    and blues tunes about revolting against 
                    mediocrity. It has that 70s before the 70s 
                    rock and roll sound “kicking” out of Fred 
                    “Sonic” Smith’s guitar, and if you have been 
                    keeping up with my thoughts this month, 
                    you know I have to highlight those dirty, 
                    heavy Micheal Davis bass riffs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The live album itself is split into two 
                    4-track parts, acting as a great divide 
                    between the style and tonal shift in the 
                    record. It’s not a crazy shift from their 
                    ongoing theme of lust and relationship issues, 
                    but it’s something that caught my attention 
                    immediately due to the stark difference in 
                    lyrics. You go from MC5’s famous 
                    “Kick out the Jams’”, a rally cry about 
                    kicking off mediocre/bands that jam 
                    (Ben would be very sad), in order for 
                    MC5 to take the stage, but then after 
                    ‘Borderline’ they transition into what 
                    I feel is the most important song of the 
                    album, ‘Motor City Burning’, a song about 
                    the 1967 riots in Detroit fighting against 
                    white oppression, and a call for revolution. 
                    It’s so subtle initially, yet its lyrics ring 
                    out so loud, and it’s only amplified by it 
                    noticeably being the slowest song on the 
                    recording (Aside from Starship but that’s 
                    its own thing).
                    All in all, I loved this album more than 
                    anything we have listened to so far, 
                    and whether you love punk, hate punk, 
                    love rock, or hate rock, I promise you 
                    just listen through those first 4 tracks 
                    and you won’t be able to stop yourself 
                    from listening to the last 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Ben as usual does a great job of 
                    explaining more of the history behind the band)

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
