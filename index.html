                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to a few days ago when we covered Minor Threat, “The First Two Records” by legendary riot-grrrl band Bikini Kill collects their first EP released in 1992 as well as their split LP with the band Huggy in 1994. Forming 20 live tracks of true punk tapes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the earliest pioneers in female led rock include Joan Jett, Heart, and Blondie. These women would pave the way for future writers and rockers in all genres. As punk entered the 90’s it started to really form around a strong idea of rebellion and activism, as our society started to become more aware of social injustices within all groups. Kathleen Hanna, the frontwoman for Bikini Kill, kept things clear and candid. Rather than hide her messages in metaphor and foggy lyricism, she outright explains to the audience the purpose behind the music. In the track “Carnival” she begins the song by highlighting the sexual harassment of young women in entertainment. To share an excerpt of the track “Thurston Hearts the Who” - Bikini Kill. You really had to be there. I got the opportunity to meet them. This D.C.-based punk foursome before the show. I was shocked at how contradictory their words and actions were. The supposed message of Bikini Kill's music and literature is "girl love" and feminism. Yeah, well, it comes across onstage as man hate, a binotic rebellion against the world an absurd. This song uses Thurston Moore, the frontman for Sonic Youth, to criticise the blind following of male rock icons, to which Hanna believes elevates group thought within music, rather than independent taste (If Sonic Youth thinks you’re cool, does that mean everything to you? Thurston Hearts the Who, how about you?). Without being too explicit I personally believe this track's message is incredibly contemporary, specifically in regards to someone we have all seen making headlines in the rock world today (IYKYK).

                <p>
                    The low fidelity, high energy of this album speaks to the raw aesthetic favored within the genre at that time. I highly recommend you give this one a listen as well as their following album, “P***sy Whipped.” Bikini Kill created a clear door for the emerging women that would take over the genre. Hailee Williams, Avril Lavigne, Kesha, Olivia Rodrigo, and more are all examples of gender empowering females who despite having a disadvantage to the men in their field, have overpowered them with sheer talent and ability. Bikini Kill was not just meant to be a punk band by women for women, but also one of the earliest examples of punk truly being for everybody.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Riot Grrrl bands. A staple of the punk genre, known for their emphasis on feminism within everyday society, politics, and the music industry, shoving the middle finger in the faces of sexism around the globe. On top of that, they RIOT, and that word should not be understated when talking about these bands, as everyone from Destroy Boys to Bratmobile make any stage and studio their opportunity to let you know what’s up. Now as far as the catalog of incredible Riot Grrrl bands go, one must recognize the influence, raw energy, and power of Bikini Kill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to go with their 2014 compilation ‘The First Two Records’, which takes from their 1992 EP ‘Revolution Girl Style Now’ and another half of the EP ‘Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah’. To describe it in one word, “Explosive”. It is a radical combination of nasty guitar hooks and Kathleen Hanna screaming in the faces of those who abuse, label, misogynists, and above all, powerhungry men. The band and their discography kickstarted the Riot Grrrl movement, and whether it’s conveyed through their pre-song conversations, or they straight up tell the audience what they mean, the band doesn’t waste any time confusing listeners, making it harder to obscure or twist their message. With it being a compilation, it gives a good mix of studio tracks, and live tracks, letting the listener experience how electric a show was. This album truly is like listening to history, as it’s the kickstart of one of the most powerful shifts in rock, reconstructing the punk genre as something not just for skaters and skinny men, but rather as a weapon for women to fight back on both social and political grounds, as well as inspire and empower generations of women to riot against a patriarchal society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now as far as my impressions were, this compilation brings the house down. Just as a punk record in general, it exceeds the bounds of what you expect, making every slam of the guitar emphasize the frustration conveyed in their lyrics. It has genuine screams (not just yelling loud into a microphone, like actual screaming) and the preludes that set up the songs such as in ‘White Boy’ make it so much more fun to listen to, like they are yelling at a physical person or group. And of course how could I not mention the incredible, gnarly, heavy bass lines coming from Kathi Wilcox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s a blast from the 90s that started one of the most powerful movements in music, which translated to even louder support from outside the industry. If you want something badass, or you want the perfect introduction to punk’s Queens of anarchy, check out Bikini Kill’s ‘The First Two Records’.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>

                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
