                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Now of the many names we have covered in this blog, both big and small, most of you are sure to recognize the infamous Social Distortion. Now, before we get to the music, I would like to share some background. Social Distortion is considered to be a Cowpunk band (cowboy + punk). These bands blended together the British punk sounds of the late 70’s with the extremely popular southern rock pallet, creating something that feels external and ethereal. Social Distortion comes out of southern California, where the subgenre began to blow up partially due to them. Influenced by bands like Sex Pistols and the Rolling Stones, Mike Ness decided to put its own sparkle on things when developing this originally hardcore band, mainly as it relates to the voicings of his music. He seems to fall in and out of swells, making for these very engaging arrangements. His dynamic control is also off the charts for how monotone he can be. This band, alongside spin-off band the Adolescents (yes, those legends) would stamp their hallmark onto the orange county underground.

                    It wouldn’t be until after a hiatus in the mid 80s that this group of rough riders would begin to shift their style to include more country and folk roots. During this within-band renaissance they put out their third album, a self titled rebirth of sorts. Now, listening through the album you would not pick up this cowpunk vibe at all. It isn’t till the tune “Story of My Life” that you begin to hear those classic telecaster riffs, with plenty of bass walkdowns and blues turnarounds sprinkled throughout. Speaking of this song, most of the album is pretty reflective. It involves Ness deciding whether or not the journey was worth it, or if the choices made could be reversed. The full on blues tune “It Coulda Been Me” references Ness’s trouble with the law, one fostered by his severe drug addiction that would eventually lead to the aforementioned hiatus. Halfway through the LP the band covers “Ring of Fire” by Johnny Cash, a call back to the men that influenced them. Funny enough because that is originally a country tune, the band had to punkify it, rather than their usual racket of adding the south to punk. The album establishes its back half with catchy ballads and more of that old-school folk flare. Attached to all of this is still this overwhelming punk-hardcore aesthetic, especially with Ness’ demanding voice. With the self titled release came a truckload of fame for Social Distortion. Mainstream success was never considered as an option for these guys, and they still act like it. Today they continue to tour and record regularly.

                    This album was one of the first I added to our list because I adore it. I find its bar-song melodies and rural sympathy to resonate with our lives here in Texas. It contains more influences than any other album we have reviewed, creating this melting pot of dangerous ideas. Take away this ball and chain. Thanks guys.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    For all the fun we have had this month covering what feels like a million pop-punk and hardcore bands, today we get to take a slight turn into a new subgenre (for both the month and myself), "Cowpunk". A subgenre defined by its mix of classic punk with blues, folk, and country music. At the top of its lengthy list of incredible groups, sits Social Distortion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The quartet out of Orange County took their love for punk favorites like The Clash and Sex Pistols, channeling it into their early album’s rebellious style and raw stage energy, making themselves known in and around Southern California for fast, aggressive punk rock. However, after over a decade of writing, producing, and a change in musical style, they hit a big break with their self titled 3rd LP. This would be their major record label debut, and allowed them to really lay into the unique fusion of southeast country lovin’ and so-cal pop punk, singing about regret, purpose, and relationships. Yet even after their smash hit 1990 release, the journey to commercial recognition, and recognition on the world stage wasn’t paved for them, using their release tour with the music icons Neil Young and Sonic Youth to propel their name to stardom, and boy did it help. That tour expanded their fanbase to folk fans, classic rock fans, alternative, and more. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth even said himself that it was one of the highlights of his career, speaking miles to the unique energy of the band and their music. The band stands today as a key influence for American punk, throwing out the many labels of punk to focus on their personal sound. It’s as beautiful as it is impressive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as my feelings go, this album perfectly encapsulates that southern sound I grew up with, and that northern blues I love, all wrapped with a classic punk bow on top that makes Social Distortion the most genre diverse album on this list. The best part is they don’t try to hide these influences behind dirty guitars or subliminal riffs, instead they come right up front and give listeners a blues rock solo (Let it Be Me), or a heavy punk, harmonica filled, make ZZ Top proud, relationship ballad (It Coulda Been Me), OR AN AMAZING COUNTRY COVER FOR CRYING OUT LOUD (Ring of Fire). It is just purely awesome in every conceivable way, and I love just how much the community praises their influence, with a favorite of mine, Lucero’s Ben Nichols publicly discussing their mutual sound and musical space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, Social Distortion’s “Social Distortion” uses excellent storytelling and musical talent to craft their 10 track ‘magnum opus’, helping to influence many different bands, with many different styles, from many different backgrounds. Best of all, they are still writing and touring, so check out their legendary self titled album, and prepare to hear a little bit of everything put together in surprisingly spectacular fashion.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
