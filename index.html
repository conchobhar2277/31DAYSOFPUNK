                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes we know what many of y’all are thinking: When are they gonna do Ramones???” Not to worry Connor and I are here to deliver, but first a little bit of context. The early 70s brought the largest shift in rock & roll since its inception. Punk was in its infancy and people from both ends of the Atlantic were hungry for this edgy sound. The up & coming royal family of rock including Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy Ramone began to shake up the scene around Queens, New York. Now in previous days we have discussed and mentioned formative punk bands such as MC5 and The Stooges, however there had not yet been a band to bring punk to the mainstream like Ramones did. Their powerful three chord melodies and quartet-style group vocals that would often assimilate the whole crowd with their performance. It is safe to say a generation of punk fans were created with this band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Rocket to Russia” (a title referencing the now historical space race) was Ramones third try at this punk stuff, and sure enough they blew it out of the water. This album signified their constant drive to escape their comfort zones. Many of the tracks are doltish and meant to almost parody the music of the 50s and 60s, which these cats grew up on. This homage and restyling of an old sound even led the band to covering a few songs for the LP, with the standout being “Surfin’ Bird” by the Trashmen. In true Ramones fashion tracks like “I Don’t Care” and “I Wanna Be Well” simply consist of a singular repeating line. My personal favorite track is one of their all time hits “Teenage Lobotomy” because as the title implies, tells the story of a young delinquent who undergoes a lobotomy. However in the song there is a lyric that states “Now I guess I’ll have to tell ’em / That I got no cerebellum.” A lobotomy is a procedure that severs the connection between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, while the cerebellum is a part of the hind brain that helps with coordination, and not taken out during a lobotomy. Now if I could travel back in time and ask Johnny Ramone what he thinks about this anatomic mishap he would probably punch me in the face. But that's Ramones for you. A legacy of pedal to the metal punk music all brought to you by one family. While none of the original four members are alive to see it, “Rocket to Russia” is without a doubt a definitive album for not only this band, but the genre as a whole. All hail Ramones.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    In no world could Benjamin and I do this project without giving proper recognition to the punk gods, Ramones. I mean at this point the surname “Ramone” and the word “Punk” are practically synonymous given their significance to the genre, writing some of the greatest rock tunes of all time and helping to pioneer the fast paced, rebellious rock n’ roll we love today. They donned their black leather jackets, and took a simple approach to writing their drum patterns and guitar melodies, yet paired with their witty lyrics and insistence on playing faster than anybody else, this New York quartet had kids dancing in all corners of the world. Today’s pick would be the immediate followup to their highly regarded debut album, making Rocket to Russia’s excellence that much more impressive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You put four song writers in a room and what do you get? In some cases the result is an ugly mesh of themes and ideas that don’t work, but in Ramones case, they double down with their humorous spins on deeper topics, including societal judgement, mental health, dysfunctional families, with some covers thrown in to show off their surf rock influences. Their use of “happy” chord progressions and light hearted vocal tones differed from the other rising punk groups of the late 70s. This unfortunately did not help them from a commercial standpoint, with the album peaking at #49 on the US charts (partially due to the negative rhetoric toward punk at the time). Of course, this didn’t matter to them, as they helped shape the genre so prideful in its opposition toward commercialism. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned earlier, part of the recipe that makes up Ramones sound was their use of simple chords and drum patterns to write their catchy tunes, making it easier to focus on playing fast and screaming lyrics. This not only set them apart as a band, but also showed the music scene that you don’t need to have the technical skill of Joe Walsh to be a great rock band, that with raw energy combined with rebellious expression would be more than enough to kickstart a whole style of rock and shake stages all across the New York underground world of the 70s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it wasn’t obvious from the first few sentences, I love love love Ramones. Ever since I started listening to punk records (my first being Green Day’s “Dookie”) at the age of 13, their music has continued to come up at just the right moments in my life. Out of the two decades of music they released, we picked today’s album because neither of us had listened to the majority of it, and “Rocket to Russia” did not disappoint. It brings the surf style instrumentals with the bad boy Queens energy you want out of Ramones, and I found it easy to catch on to their lyrics, making it a great album to jam out to with others. As a whole, the album feels like an honest extension of their debut, and it continues to astound me that they didn’t have more commercial success, but maybe that’s just the way the 70s saw it, loud, obnoxious, uncontrollable music, the perfect feedback for any punk band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So strap in for “Rocket to Russia” and dance to the incredible second record made by the forefathers of American punk rock.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
