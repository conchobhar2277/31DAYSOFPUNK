                    Riot Grrrl bands. A staple of the punk genre, known for their emphasis on feminism within everyday society, politics, and the music industry, shoving the middle finger in the faces of sexism around the globe. On top of that, they RIOT, and that word should not be understated when talking about these bands, as everyone from Destroy Boys to Bratmobile make any stage and studio their opportunity to let you know what’s up. Now as far as the catalog of incredible Riot Grrrl bands go, one must recognize the influence, raw energy, and power of Bikini Kill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to go with their 2014 compilation ‘The First Two Records’, which takes from their 1992 EP ‘Revolution Girl Style Now’ and another half of the EP ‘Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah’. To describe it in one word, “Explosive”. It is a radical combination of nasty guitar hooks and Kathleen Hanna screaming in the faces of those who abuse, label, misogynists, and above all, powerhungry men. The band and their discography kickstarted the Riot Grrrl movement, and whether it’s conveyed through their pre-song conversations, or they straight up tell the audience what they mean, the band doesn’t waste any time confusing listeners, making it harder to obscure or twist their message. With it being a compilation, it gives a good mix of studio tracks, and live tracks, letting the listener experience how electric a show was. This album truly is like listening to history, as it’s the kickstart of one of the most powerful shifts in rock, reconstructing the punk genre as something not just for skaters and skinny men, but rather as a weapon for women to fight back on both social and political grounds, as well as inspire and empower generations of women to riot against a patriarchal society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now as far as my impressions were, this compilation brings the house down. Just as a punk record in general, it exceeds the bounds of what you expect, making every slam of the guitar emphasize the frustration conveyed in their lyrics. It has genuine screams (not just yelling loud into a microphone, like actual screaming) and the preludes that set up the songs such as in ‘White Boy’ make it so much more fun to listen to, like they are yelling at a physical person or group. And of course how could I not mention the incredible, gnarly, heavy bass lines coming from Kathi Wilcox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s a blast from the 90s that started one of the most powerful movements in music, which translated to even louder support from outside the industry. If you want something badass, or you want the perfect introduction to punk’s Queens of anarchy, check out Bikini Kill’s ‘The First Two Records’.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.

                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
