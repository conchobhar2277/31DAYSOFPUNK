                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Ah Dead Kennedys, one of the defining punk bands of the 80s led their charge for just 8 years. Through the duration of this short flame, a storm of west-coast surf punk fury burned brightly. The influence of these cats reached past the umbrella of punk and seeped its way into many other subgenres, including the kings of thrash-metal and San Francisco siblings Metallica. Jello Biafra fronts the band with an almost billygoat-like yell, ringing through the streets of the tenderloin district. East Bay Ray’s guitar tone is known far and wide and would play a great deal into the formation of Ska-punk. Klaus Fluoride’s high gain bass and Ted’s drumming (yes there is no last name) would be the rhythmic sauce needed to complete this foursome. They did briefly have a rhythm guitarist named 6025, but he left early on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today’s album “Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death” is a compilation consisting of some recording sessions and a few live tapes such as “Pull My Strings,” a song about the suppression of dreams. Similar to other punk bands in this transformative era (see yesterday's album) Dead Kennedy’s did not pay any mind to the record labels, and instead opted to be as vulgar as possible. Crude titles such as “Kinky Sex Makes the World Go ‘Round” and “Too Drunk to F**k” swarm this album. The topics range from adolescent dysfunction to drunken nights of mayhem, all of which help enforce the abnormal, chaotic, and monty-python-esque album cover art. It is a never ending carnival of sound that still finds space for nuance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dead Kennedys might not have lasted too long, but they put out a total of 116 tracks within their tenure. More than many artists put out in decades of work. This musical engagement is the most obvious reason for their continued success post career. As every generation finds their way to punk, may they see the footsteps made by this group.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    “We’re not a punk rock band, we’re a new wave band”
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you thought we were done covering compilations, you were wrong, because today’s pick is arguably the most satirical, antagonizing, and famous punk compilation of all time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Screaming out of San Francisco, California, Dead Kennedys were a Reagan era four piece band attacking anything that reeked of consumerism, crummy politics, selling out, and fascism. Hell, they even attacked punk rock in their live track “Pull my Strings”, responding to record labels slapping the “punk” title on commercial groups not representing the genre, in an effort to gain a profit. Now this really shouldn’t come as a surprise for a group with the name “Dead Kennedys”, and it's more than apparent they wanted to be heard given their electric live performances (which are featured in this compilation), and Jello Biafra’s unique, moaning vocals. To support this circus of instigative lyrics, you have East Bay Ray on the Guitar, Klaus Fluoride on those ever so prominent Bass parts (so good), and D.H. Peligro manning the drums. It all comes together in spectacular fashion, creating a group that ruled the west coast punk scene, unafraid to scream in your face about uncomfortable topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stepping away from the lyrics, you can hear and feel that west coast energy booming out of their instruments. It's those surfer style guitar riffs mixed with their take on hardcore, and a touch of the British punk movement that makes this band so intriguing. Unfortunately, in 1986 the band came to an end due to a number of factors, including inner turmoil due to royalty disputes and controversy surrounding their Frankenchrist album art. Nonetheless, the band would become a staple in the west coast punk scene, making its mark on the genre through voicing the opinions others were afraid to share, and doing so in a spunky, fast, and outright rebellious manner.

                    I have spoken before about how much I enjoy compilations, and in the case of “Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death”, it allows the listener to hear some of their early singles, their hits, and their infamous live performances. The tracks each hold distinct characteristics that help drive their messages. My favorite example of this is in “California Uber Alles”, where the heavy use of one drum replicates a marching beat, supporting their view of Jerry Brown being a “dictator”, and enforcing his control over California. It makes every song interesting, and allows a certain level of imagery within the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being a favorite of mine, this album brings me that older punk sound while also using strikingly contemporary music. I also enjoyed the handful of talking performances, with the band playing behind a sermon directed at whatever, and whoever they wanted to defy. Combined with the force of Biafra’s voice, and the energy from the band, I really had just a fantastic time listening to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given their history, their controversy, and their incredible music, Dead Kennedys formed a large dent in the American punk scene, becoming a household name to many, and an inspiration to greats. If you are looking for something fast enough to wake you up, and interesting enough to hook you in, check out “Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death”.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
