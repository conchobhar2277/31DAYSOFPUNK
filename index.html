                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    I am walking through Tower Records in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, when I behold myself to an entire aisle dedicated to punk music. Out of pure curiosity I took a gander at their new releases section, highlighting a black & white over the top album cover of four men in full studded hot-topic fashion. That is all I needed to know that Bansoko was a band I could not help myself but listen to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “二十一世紀ノ大事件” *The Great Event of the Twenty-First Century* is a four song EP thriller thrashing the listeners ears with gargled singing and classic punk instrumentals. These cats certainly take after the greats in that they show no signs of stopping throughout the entire listen. Bansoko, translating to “Band-aid” had their first release in 2024 titled “Tokyo Machine Gun” which is fitting considering this band is the hallmark of a growing punk scene within Tokyo. While obviously not as big as it is in the west, Punk music has gradually created its own subculture within these bustling crowded cities, with the style and aesthetic remaining absolutely fluent. With this album's release I found myself beginning to enjoy this genre once more when previously I had placed it on hold in my active listening schedule. Bansoko brings a new angle to a vintage sound, making this album (and band) one of my favorite releases of 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience with this album is a perfect example as to why record stores are so important for music culture, even if you do not listen to physical media. Without Tower records being accessible I would never have held that cd and discovered this great band. Bansoko proves that punk has no native language, because it is a universal one.
                </p>

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Walking through the shelves of Tower Records in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Benjamin and I were in awe of their incredible collection of physical media. We went from floor to floor, sampling all the setups they had for new music around the world, featuring western records such as The Smashing Pumpkins “Aghori Mhori Mei” and Kendrick Lamar’s “GNX”. Eventually, Ben stumbled across a black and white cover with 4 sets of eyes staring back, enticing us to listen to their music. That 2025 EP was Bansoko’s “二十一世紀ノ大事件”, which translates to “The Great Event of the Twenty-first Century”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the duration of this 4 track EP, Bansoko delivers a listening experience that rivals the punk greats of the west. Much like some of those greats, it includes dirty bass and guitar parts, fast melodies, and a grittiness to the vocals that amplifies their unique sound. Now, it cannot be overstated that rock in Japan is huge, producing some incredible artists not only featured in the anime intros and video game soundtracks we all love, but also as touring acts, spreading their phenomenal music worldwide. Bansoko is among the rising punk acts out of the country, staying true to the older punk sound of bands like GISM, and screaming messages of social criticism and frustration. It is a cluster of raw energy that is released by their musical talent, making it clear they want the audience to hear the angst of their chorus. Due to how young the band is, it is hard to find any history on them but with song titles like “Shonen Dynamite”, this EP and band is as punk as it gets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This became a top release of 2025 for me almost immediately (disregarding recency bias of course). It’s right up the alley of those who love fast music with someone yelling at you to move in every direction and dance, making your headphones a wreck room for your ears. It reminds me about why I love listening to international music, since I cannot understand the lyrics, I get to let the kick of drums and the slam of guitars dictate the emotions of the track, creating a unique listening experience I crave more and more everyday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So check out Bansoko’s “The Great Event of the Twenty-first Century” and tear through its four tracks while banging your head to its loyal punk sound, because like Ben said, whether you can read the lyrics or not, you understand.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>

                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
