                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s 2025 and the whole world knows about IDLES. As one of the leading names in punk rock this group boils down to a bunch of rowdy, ragtag rockers from England who have formed what they call the “angry band.” Hopefully while keeping up with this blog you have been listening to the albums, and if so you will notice just how obviously different this one sounds from the rest. IDLES blend heavy riffs, percussive soundscapes, and what sounds like aggressive spoken word poetry to create a sound completely unique to them, and the scene loves it.
                    Today we are covering their first album, “Brutalism” which was released in 2017. The record explores loss, grief, and societal decay through the eyes of lead singer Joe Talbot. From loud cymbals to high gain riffs the instrumentals serve this album's bleak and grungy aesthetic in such a satisfying way. The album cover features a picture of Talbot’s late mother (who died during the recording of the LP) as well as a sculpture made by his father. His take on Britain's failure to help provide for its poor and its systemic bias towards the nation's white and elite is perfectly executed throughout these 13 tracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The very nature of punk music relies on the anger/aggression of the band performing. The genre is built on those who were bold enough to publicly yell out their transgressions to the world. And no matter who the disgust is pointed at (nation, neighbors, self, etc.) the shared bond through collective indignation is what carries the music through generations. IDLES have taken that concept to the moon by making it almost impossible to listen to this record and not feel a fire in your belly. It is truly no wonder that their fans claim that they have one of the best live atmospheres touring today, everybody wants a piece of this fury-pie.  The flow and feel of this album from ear splitting tracks like “Heel/Heal” to “Benzocaine” make for a truly high octane listening experience, and one that places it in the must listens for any punk fan. Hear the anger, hear the music, hear the IDLES.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    I want to open my thoughts by talking about my favorite part of album structures, and that’s the opener. Heel/Heal, temporarily ignoring the lyrics dive into societal pressure to live a “standard” life, takes Joe Talbot’s voice to the limits, starting softer, then gradually building and breaking to reflect his frustration. While I might be a sucker for a good scream, this has nothing to do with why I enjoy it as an opener. Given ‘Brutalism’ was written and re-written in the wake of Talbot’s mother passing (pictured on the album cover), it serves its purpose as a perfect way to set up an album built off of mourning, frustration, anger, and healing. On top of that, the Idles make a statement about their hardcore sound off the rip, setting the tone for the rest of the 13 total tracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talbot has expressed in interviews how he felt “nobody would enjoy the record” and that it was “hard to listen to”, and maybe in 2017 it was less commercially popular to listen to British post-punk, or maybe hardcore rock was not selling, but history would say no, given that hardcore favorites like Turnstile and Knocked Loose got their starts around the same time and are thriving in the turn of the decade. Maybe it was the nerves of starting a band combined with the grief of losing his mother, but luckily for Idles, their debut would be positively received around the world, helping to stoke the flame that is post-punk. The album doesn’t just focus on that tragic area of Talbot’s life, but also delves into topics surrounding privilege, toxic relationships, and male vulnerability. They really lean into their sound, taking advantage of every moan and groan that outlines the rapid drum parts and the scratch on those higher guitar frets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as my opinion goes, this record quickly soared to one of my all time post-punk favorites. Idles have amazing hits and over the last few years I've had the pleasure of getting to listen to them, but this album front to back is my kind of taste, urging me to start banging my head and moving my legs to keep up with the moshpit in my headphones. While it's one of the pillar tropes of punk music, this album made me forget, and duly reminded me just how much I enjoy fast tracks, as Idles shows off their incredible musical talent among the band.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if this album reminds you of your loss, or of your problems with the world around you, or even an ex-girlfriend, jam the hell out and feel the heavy beat of Idles debut record, ‘Brutalism’.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.

                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
