                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                   "Children of the beast embrace, to scorn and hate the human race.
                    Consume the light that hugs the earth, and aid the womb in giving birth...to a group that will appear and guide you through this final year.
                    The dark armies then will come, when the Sum is 41.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the turn of the century, the most listened to subgenre of rock was pop-punk. Bands like Green Day and Blink-182 were topping the charts and in response these Canadian born rockers released their first album in 2000 titled “Half Hour of Power.” A year later they followed that up with the release of “All Killer, No Filler” which is not only a key album of the genre, but also an era-defining release. You can ask any teenager of the early 2000s and I guarantee you they know this album.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above are the spoken lyrics to the first track in the LP, “Introduction to Destruction,” which feeds directly into the next song “Nothing On My Back. Fun fact: this interlude takes direct inspiration from Iron Maiden's “Number of the Beast” intro. Sidebar: Musically, what defined many of these pop-punk bands was the idea of continuity and flow throughout their albums. Tracks feed into each other creating a very full listening experience, like one long punk opera. This is actually derived from jazz and blues bands, which center around calling songs to transition to. The principle was first brought into rock & roll in the 60s with psychedelic Jam-bands such as Grateful Dead (my favorite band). Okay, done with the soapbox. This album is 100% genuine fun. It screams early 2000s Americana (silly because they are Canadian), with vans wearing skaters and west coast flare. Songs like “Fat Lip” and “In Too Deep” completely smashed the charts that year. Every teen comedy of the time used their music, with the most notable use being in “American Pie 2” (Connor and I love this movie). 
                </p>

                    I want to take a moment and appreciate the album cover for AKNF, which features blurry images of the band members with air being blown at their faces. This collage is reminiscent of the great parties of the era, fueled by hard and fast punk music. Frontman Deryck Whibley, the mastermind behind this album, gripes about all the struggles of young life. Fast change, shaky relationships, and the fatigue of a redundant schedule. He was later quoted saying “life is all about ups and downs, you just have to be able to ride the waves.” The message this album puts out is in order to truly realize how great life is, pain is sometimes going to bite you in the ass, and that's okay. Sum 41 not only made the party album of the year with All Killer, No Filler. They made what I consider a perfect rock album.

                <p>
                    “Tom DeLonge would have fed generations with the Heart Attack guitar riff” - Ben and I over the years
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m 13 years old, sitting in the back of my Mom’s car at the beginning of my first Summer (ironic given the name of the band) as a teenager, and i'm tapping my leg to the drums of whatever Houston’s 94.5 The Buzz was playing. Then I hear those opening chords, followed by the heavy drop of the same guitar before looking up at the radio to see the bolded words “Fat Lip”, “by Sum 41”, “All Killer, No Filler”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As one of the many musical greats to come from our friends up north in Canada, Sum 41 took pop-punk to a new level, blending the fast, upbeat style rooted in the sub-genre with heavy instrumentals, hip-hop interludes, and metal inspired riffs. Their second studio album titled ‘All Killer, No Filler’ was Deryck Whibley and the band’s statement to the world that this album would be, well… “All Killer, and no Filler”, which judging based on the numbers, they called their shot. Selling over 1.5 million by 2002 and achieving the top 30 albums of 2001, this album was the perfect soundtrack for high schoolers, skaters, stoners, and of course listeners all over the world who fell in love with the quick 13 track punk record that put Sum 41 on the map. An album made by a bunch of 21 year olds who were channeling what could only be described as “early 2000s older brother” vibes, it's almost hilarious they finished it in the first place. However, after having been produced by Jerry Finn (who famously almost quit due to the band trashing his apartment after getting high on mushrooms) the album lived up to its name, creating a unique style of pop-punk and highlighting messages about youth, rebellious acts, mental health, and relationship trouble. Its popularity can be attested not only to the amazing musical talent that is Dave Baksh, Jason McCaslin, and Steve Jocz, but really because of its highly relatable nature. It’s not a political album, and it was never meant to cater towards those interested in rebelling against the Government (They already had Rage Against the Machine for that), but rather to the young adult who wanted freedom from the conformity of school, work, and home. It's a heart to heart with everyone who has ever felt trapped by the struggles of everyday life, reminding them that it's gonna be alright.

                    Now, when Benjamin and I were deciding what albums we would be doing for the month, I don’t know if I could’ve gone through with the project without dedicating a day to one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time. In my opinion it’s a perfect record, meant to be listened to front-to-back with no skips. While putting it on this list may seem biased, it doesn’t need Ben and I geeking out to prove its worth, it does that through its catchy lyrics and metal guitar hooks that make you wonder if the guys hired Dave Mustaine to play a track or two (go listen to the last song ‘Pain for Pleasure’). It became the anthem of my youth and I credit it with introducing me to so much more pop-punk like New Found Glory, Avril Lavigne, and Good Charlotte. It hits that “Rodrick” energy everyone loves, and to this day continues to remind me of the house parties, ding-dong ditches, and tooling off I did growing up in a suburb of Houston.

                    So when you’re feeling nostalgic over your teenage days as an underclassman, when you need a pick-me up stronger than some coffee, or when you’re a 13 year old kid looking to explore music outside of what your Dad listens to, put on Sum 41’s ‘All Killer, No Filler’, and jump around to what quickly became an essential of punk catalogs.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
                </P>
                <p>
                    We hope you enjoy this as much as we do!
