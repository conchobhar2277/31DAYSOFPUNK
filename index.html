                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    In the short list of essential albums on this calendar, Never Mind The Bollocks clears the line by miles. Now, In the world of rock and roll to become a household name it requires at least a few major releases to achieve such legendary status. However these punk gods only released one album, and from its debut in 1977 it seated itself in the anarchy hall of fame. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it was self-deprecation or the lack of censorship Sex Pistols were a band of the people, but not for the people, if that makes sense. Songs like “Bodies” and “No Feelings” show off their intense disdain for not just for their neighbor, but also themselves. The anger and frustration of just being alive is the resounding theme of this album. I think that is what attracted so many people to these guys. We all hold insecurities just as much as we are annoyed by others sometimes (for some more often than not). And when the punk movement began to sweep over Britain, these high energy young guns wasted no time in getting on the radio. Sex Pistols, following in the footsteps of their sibling band The Clash began a cult-like movement. One full of giant mohawks, studded belts, and an attitude. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legacy of this album cannot be overstated, there is no punk band out there that does not give Sex Pistols some credit, because as previously stated, punk rides a whole lot on attitude. All these rockstars every year that are thrashed by the media for being mysterious and douchey are only keeping up the reputations of men like John Lydon. 
                    While yes, this is an album spewing disgust for each other, in an ironic way it has brought more people together than apart. Punk and the underground scene were always intended to be spaces for those who felt outcast and unworthy to go and forget about the world just to rock out. Lifelong bonds are made at these shows and while yes the music may contradict this, punk music in its lengthy history, has become a genre of love. Sex Pistols were just the officiators of a 60 year long (and counting) marriage of rock and roll. May god save the Sex Pistols.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    You should bring up Sex Pistols in a conversation with your friends and pay attention to their reactions. Some might recognize the name as a monument in the punk genre, some might shake their head in disgust over the history behind their infamous bass player, Sid Vicious, and some might just shrug their shoulders. No matter their opinion on the band, one thing is for certain, Sex Pistols ‘Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols’ took punk to commercial popularity at a scale where the messages of Johnny Rotten and the band couldn’t be ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A defining statement of the 70s, this politically charged album flashes the middle finger to the British government, showcasing their frustration with the treatment of the working class, and exploring controversial topics in abortion, isolation, and nihilism in the UK. Now 1977 wasn’t the first year punk became a thing in the country, however Sex Pistols and their debut (and only) studio album topped the UK charts just two weeks after its release, making front pages, selling a crazy amount of records, and turning the heads of the British monarchy. This didn’t just make the band a household name, it took punk in the UK to center stage, leading the way for some of the greatest punk acts of all time including The Clash and X-Ray Spex (shoutout my friend Rees). Of course, you can’t have punk rock without someone trying to shut it up, and it wasn’t just those in the aristocracy. Notably, the British Broadcasting Corporation banned ‘God Save the Queen’ for its anti-establishment lyrics, and of course as the final nail in coffin, the guitarist Steve Jones cussed out a talk show host on live television, sending the UK media into a spiral. This gave them an unofficial ban from television and the radio in the Country. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I sit here writing this, directly in front of my face is that plasma pink CD case, hung up on my wall. I love this album and everything it brought to the genre. It's not just in its contemporary themes or in its history, but rather its way of immersing the listener in that emotion we all experience, frustration. It’s that adrenaline you feel in the bass and that march in the drums that is just an unapologetically british riot for your ears. I don’t know and I don’t want to know what and where punk would be without this record, and for those 12 tracks, you’d have to cut off my fingers before I'd skip one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So next time Sex Pistols are brought up in conversation, you can tell all your friends your theory on the Sid Vicious case, you can remind them of the legendary Glen Matlock and his less then often credited bass lines, and you can all collectively thank Sex Pistols for their jewel in the crown of punk.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.
                </p>

                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.

                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
