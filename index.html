                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>These west coast pop-punk giants found themselves in a burst of 
                    popularity around the late 90’s with releases like Cheshire Cat, 
                    Dude Ranch, and their smash hit album Enema of the State. 
                    And while their angsty, teenage hormone-filled lyrics were 
                    apparent from the start, nothing quite matched their stage 
                    presence, which could only be described as a punk comedy opera. 
                    This live album perfectly encapsulates why Blink-182 was one of 
                    the highest selling touring acts of that era. Between their 
                    improvised swapping of lyrics, to their inter-song banter 
                    (in which they spared no topic), to employing the use of 
                    a voice changer so that Satan could join them on stage, 
                    critics could bash them all they wanted, but no one reached 
                    the modern audience quite like the shameless members of 
                    Blink-182. And unfortunately for the prudes, all three 
                    permanent members of the band were great musicians. 
                    Tom DeLonge was the riff king of the genre, Mark Hoppus 
                    could not stop hitting his bass, and Travis Barker is 
                    maybe the best known for inventing his own style of drumming. 
                    Like them or love them, if you want to hear the real Blink-182, 
                    listen to The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show!</p>

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>Starting off a blog celebrating punk  
                    seems weird for a band that 
                    advertises themselves as the “Finest Quality <strong>Crappy</strong> Punk Rock”, 
                    but with their mix of immature humor and ludicrously fast guitar, 
                    bass, and drums, this album serves as an unofficial 
                    compilation of blink’s golden years, 
                    and highlights the unique nature of the band that elevated pop-punk 
                    from the 90s through the turn of the century. Whether 
                    it's the banter between Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge, 
                    or the lyrics “Take off your pants” being added into 
                    not one, but two songs, blink exemplifies what punk is, bringing the feeling of being a 
                    rebellious teen in the 90s to the stage, dirty jokes and all.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's worth mentioning it's not all potty humor and dick jokes, 
                    blink takes their unserious dynamic and uses that to write some 
                    really good music, and in my opinion it's the silly songs like 
                    ‘Family Reunion’ that make serious songs like ‘Adam’s Song’ 
                    hit that much harder. To back that up, Mark Hoppus, Travis Barker, and 
                    Tom DeLonge show off in these two recorded performances why they are 
                    widely considered some of the best in their respective instruments, 
                    and as they continued to produce after this, they only got better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All that said, blink-182 has a special place in my heart. 
                    They served as the soundtrack to my high school years, reminding me not to take everything so seriously, and enjoy being a 
                    teenager with teenager-problems. Today, as a college student, 
                    blink continues to remind me of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So whether you love blink, you have never heard of blink, or you just 
                    want to laugh at the voice-changer Satan bits they do between songs, 
                    you can’t go wrong with giving this album a listen.

                <h2>What is 31 Days of Punk?</h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary defines Punk Rock as,
                </p>
                <p><strong>"A loud, fast-moving, and aggressive form of rock music, popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s."</strong></p>
                <p>
                    But punk music is so much more than what a dictionary says it is. In fact, the rebellious nature of punk rock would probably argue against a definition at all.
                    Punk rock took the rock and roll of the 50s and 60s, and said "How do we break the rules", to which broken voices, fast tempos, and dirty guitars responded as the spark 
                    that ignited a new genre of music, and quickly became the arbiter of counterculture for generations to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    31 Days of Punk is a celebration of punk music for the entire month of December. Each day, we will introduce a new punk album spanning from its roots in the 60s, to the noisy, coming of age pop-punk of the 90s, to contemporary punk that rocks the concert halls of today. 
                    There will be no repeating artists, and to try and cover every corner of this massive genre, each entry will have a category tied to it, including <strong> 
                    International, Ska-punk, Afro-punk</strong> and many more! We will share our thoughts on each album, from the historical details to the general reasons why we love them, and more about how these albums have shaped our listening experiences through the years.

                    The intention of this blog is not to critique or rank these albums, but rather to celebrate and elevate the music that we love so much. For anyone who is unfamiliar with this genre, 
                    this blog may also act as a blueprint of great albums to start with.
