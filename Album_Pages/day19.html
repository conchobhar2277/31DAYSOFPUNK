                    The Bombpops, a co-fronted punk squad from Oceanside, California revisits a sound of yesteryear in their 2018 EP “Dear Beer” with smooth vocals and rhythm breakdowns fit for a king. Connor specifically requested this selection be reviewed today because it is our 21st birthday! And unlike the lyrics of their album opener, we will not be drinking alone tonight.

                    Poli van Dam and Jen Razavi scorch through this 4 song release, all while tackling themes of city isolation, destruction, and deception. While listening Connor exclaimed that these songs contain some of his all time favorite bass lines, concocted at the hands of Neil Wayne. Fun fact, this band went through several lineup changes, including six different bassists and three drummers. While it has never been uncommon for bands in other subgenres to have two fronts, punk seems to stray away from the co-leads. I believe that this is mainly because like several rock acts, the lead is an integral part of the overall image of the band, and when there are two people fronting, like the women of the Bombpops, egos can start to clash (see: Blink-182). However this does not seem to be an issue for van Dam or Razavi as they have been kicking it for nearly 20 long years.

                    There is a sharp feeling of glee that I get when listening to this release, everything seems to flow so smoothly because the pacing is perfect. In the pop-punk sector it can be very difficult to establish a cohesive style, but the Bombpops seem to have settled that. The entire listen will not take you more than 15-20 minutes, so I highly recommend you check it out.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    When Benjamin and I were planning out what albums were gonna be on which days, we only had a few we wanted a particular record to fall on. Today is one of those days. Dear Beer, a four song EP that pushes pop punk to greater limits with its string instrumentals perfectly representing the subgenre’s Southern California roots, and in similar fashion, their lyrics display the universal experiences of an everyday person.

                    San Diego is no stranger to pop punk (with blink-182 arguably being the most famous band out of the city), and the Bombpops used its rich music scene to elevate themselves within the genre. The co-founders Poli van Dam and Jen Razavi met at a young age, and bonded over their shared love of music. After a brief stint in Power Metal, van Dam and Razavi decided to form their own group, straying from their shared uninterest in Power Metal, and leaning toward the upbeat and fast nature of pop punk. Having been a band since 2007, they went through multiple line-up changes before releasing their first full-length LP a decade later in 2017, and since then have toured with some of the greatest acts in punk such as NOFX and The Descendents. A year later, they released their strongest studio performance to date, Dear Beer, and took themes of un-met expectations, isolation, and  experiencing life in an urban landscape, turning them into melodic ballads fit not just for teenagers, but the everyday person. The EP wasn’t meant to have the teenage angst appeal of blink-182, nor was it trying to be reminiscent of the sprawling LA hardcore punk scene. The short 11 minute record served as a reminder pop punk wasn’t dead, especially at a time when it was fleeting in the industry, and its members' musical prowess helped to round out the EP in the most Southern California pop punk fashion.

                    I have been waiting for today all month long. Serving as my favorite pop punk EP of all time, I truly can’t get enough of the dual fronted vocals of Poli van Dam and Jen Razavi, creating an electric atmosphere that can’t be compared to anyone else. On top of that, the band is host to Bassist Neil Wayne, and Drummer Josh Lewis, who hold down the speedy rhythms so familiar to the genre. To highlight what is undoubtedly my favorite part of the album, Neil Wayne wrote and performed my number one favorite bass line of all time, that being the opening to “Dear Beer”. It is fast, technical, and features that high harmonic tone that frequents pop-punk bass. This album took me through my freshman year of college, and in a time when I wasn’t happy with the situation I was in, it served as a reminder that everything takes its own course, and ups and downs are natural to life.

                    So take the 11 minutes to enjoy this wonderful display of Southern California’s pop punk soul, and maybe it’ll help ease the troubled circumstances you might be facing in life, and better yet, convince you to let loose, and jump around to the catchy, upbeat melodies of The Bombpops (named of course, after the popsicle).
