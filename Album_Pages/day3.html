                <p>
                    In the late 70s Punk music began to take over 
                    the world like a tidal wave, and a product of 
                    this rock & roll renaissance was Eskorbuto, a 
                    band formed in 1980 nestled in the fishing town 
                    of Santurtzi, Basque Country (northern Spain). 
                    Eskorbuto is much more than just one of the 
                    first exclusively spanish speaking punk bands, 
                    they are a cultural legacy that continues to 
                    thrive today. At the time of the band's 
                    conception, Basque had just become partially 
                    autonomous from Spain, which was met with 
                    tension by the public. During this time an 
                    armed separatist group (ETA) carried out waves 
                    of assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings 
                    mainly targeting state officials. If the history 
                    of punk has taught us anything, it's that this 
                    music is intended to be used as a tool to spread 
                    awareness of societal injustice, a time just 
                    like this. Eskorbuto became the call and the 
                    catalyst for a cultural genesis in this region.

                    In 1985 the band would release their standout 
                    album Anti Todo, with frontman Iosu Expósito 
                    delivering one of the strongest vocal recordings 
                    of the genre. What rips just as much are the 
                    strong bass lines, surprisingly funk driven, 
                    coming from Juanma Suarez. Pako Galán was a 
                    punk drummer if there ever was one, breaking 
                    sticks on almost every song. The album opens 
                    with “Historia Triste (Sad Story)” which 
                    highlights the bleakness of societal decay. 
                    Later we hear the only track marked explicit 
                    in the whole album “Cerebros Destruidos” 
                    which focuses on the sociopolitical conditions 
                    at the time leading to government manipulation 
                    and the degradation of critical thinking among 
                    the nation, which was likely a critique of 
                    Basque Country’s heavy anti-terrorism policies 
                    that in reality created a police state 
                    (The band would later be arrested for their 
                    song “E.T.A.”). What I love most about the 
                    album are the very final seconds, when Expósito 
                    alone whistles the classic American tune 
                    “Yankee Doodle,” a song often associated with 
                    national freedom.

                    The music of Eskorbuto is still celebrated 
                    today, with countless punk bands covering 
                    their songs and even the last original member 
                    Pako Galán stepping back into the light to 
                    remind us of his legend. Punk music would 
                    not have the reach it does without this band, 
                    and when you put on Anti Todo and hear the 
                    howls of Iosu Expósito, whether you speak 
                    Spanish or not, you understand the language.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    I don’t believe in music without emotion, 
                    because what is one without the other. 
                    Music sparks emotion and emotion sparks music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s a cheesy way to open up my thoughts about 
                    Anti Todo by Eskorbuto, which as a non-spanish speaker, 
                    emotion had a big role in my listening experience. 
                    Now, it would be wrong of me to play off Eskorbuto 
                    as some run-of-the-mill punk band from the 80s, 
                    as they are one of the most influential Spanish 
                    bands of all time, blending fast and dirty 
                    guitar riffs with loud, jarring lyrics about the 
                    political climate in Spain and the isolation of 
                    their own members. The album name alone is a 
                    testament to what they stood for, which translates 
                    in English to “Anti-Everything”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s hard to say what Guitarist Iosu Expósito 
                    and Bassist Juanma Suárez would be doing in 
                    today’s political climate, with their tragic 
                    deaths ending the band’s short run, but 
                    during that time, they definitely wanted 
                    their message to be heard, and as their 
                    trophy, were insulted, censored, and condemned 
                    by the state and the law. Very punk rock if 
                    you ask me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I think Benjamin does a great job explaining 
                    more of the history behind the band and their lyrics, but as 
                    far as the album goes, it's a blast of that 
                    rebellious British punk of the 70s, but in 
                    all honesty, much more angry. Going back to 
                    what I mentioned before, I don’t know Spanish, 
                    and while I did look up the English translation, 
                    it’s plain as day that this band was frustrated, sad, and beaten, 
                    looking for a platform to share their anger,
                    to which would be seen by many as a nihilistic 
                    outlook on life. The bone-deep emotions expressed 
                    by their two dueling vocalists, makes the average 
                    listener, such as me, incredibly invested in why 
                    the hell they are screaming my ears off. 
                    It's fast, beautiful, and enticing, all 
                    words that remind me of great punk records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, Eskorbuto’s “manifesto”, Anti Todo, 
                    is a loud way to introduce yourself to one of 
                    punk music’s many greats, and the history that 
                    rallied a community of listeners who were tired 
                    of everything the world had to offer.
