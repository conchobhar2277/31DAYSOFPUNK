                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>The word “Punk” loses part of its meaning 
                    without mentioning The Misfits, a band whose 
                    impact on the genre far exceeds most of their 
                    colleagues. Their album “Static Age” recorded 
                    in 1978 is a rocket of fast paced, 
                    chest pounding, politically contemporary lyrics. 
                    And while the album was recorded within 30 hours 
                    of studio time, none of it feels rushed. In true 
                    Misfits fashion, Glenn Danzig never stops belting 
                    for all 17 tracks, which oddly enough makes many 
                    of the transitions seamless throughout the entire 
                    listening experience. One of the singles for the 
                    album "Bullet” takes us through the Kennedy 
                    assassination. A frightening, rageful outburst 
                    reminiscent of the public's feelings towards 
                    political violence at the time, especially when 
                    it came to one of the most progressive presidents 
                    of the 20th century. The line “Texas is the 
                    reason that the president’s dead” rings out 
                    like a call to action. The resounding theme 
                    of the album is our human drive towards sex. 
                    Encased not only in passionate emotion, but 
                    also in power, abuse, and hatred. 
                    “Hollywood Babylon” asks the listener 
                    if the citizens kneel for sex, and 
                    "Teenagers from Mars” tells the story of 
                    a couple of extraterrestrial adolescents
                     going on an invasive rampage without need 
                     for justification, as they view the Earth's 
                     people as mindless and meaningless.

                    The Misfits deliver some of the best tracks of 
                    their discography with this release. It is no 
                    surprise that this band, and album, are etched 
                    deep into the punk hall of fame, inspiring 
                    countless artists and bands for decades to come. 
                    If you want to feel that classic, loud, and 
                    angry music that pioneered the punk genre, 
                    look no further than Static Age.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Gross, violent, heavy. The three words 
                    I would choose to describe Static Age by The Misfits. 
                    With lyrics like “The insemination of little girls 
                    in the middle of wet dreams”, it’s hard to not feel 
                    uncomfortable listening to The Misfits discography, 
                    but that’s exactly what makes them one of the most 
                    unique bands of all time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recorded in 30 hours, Static Age is filled with some of 
                    The Misfits greatest hits like ‘Last Caress’, ‘She’, and 
                    ‘Angelfuck’ which utilize controversial and uncomfortable 
                    lyrics to enthrall listeners into their sub-genre, Horror-punk. 
                    They rip through 17 tracks of brain-throbbing bass lines to 
                    support the heavy nature of the band, and treat each song like 
                    a sprint to scream about the most contentious topics the late 
                    70s had to offer. It’s also worth mentioning that for an album 
                    recorded in the 70s and released in the 90s, the content of 
                    their songs is unsurprisingly contemporary, supporting the 
                    many reasons they continue to captivate younger listeners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From my first listen of ‘Bullet’ to my obsession with the 
                    inner turmoil of Glenn Danzig, the band, and their audience, 
                    I don’t know if there is a more distinctive band I've 
                    listened to in my life, and as far as my Mt. Rushmore of 
                    punk goes, The Misfits take the first spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shortest-longest album of this month, 
                    and possibly my favorite, Static Age is the 
                    perfect entry into the grotesque world of The 
                    Misfits, and I could not recommend it more.
