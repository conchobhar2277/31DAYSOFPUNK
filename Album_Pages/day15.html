                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Maruja put the hammer down this year with the release of their first LP “Pain to Power” bellowing jazz-infused high energy break-beat punk anthems focused on solidarity. Frontman Harry Wilkinson makes the band’s Manchester roots well known by emphasizing his accent. It is difficult to write an accurate description of Maruja’s sound, it is something you must listen to yourself.

                    Drums and horns are the obvious interest factor for this band musically, however their lyrics are worth diving into. Songs like “Look Down On Us” create graphic and vulgar imagery of a class war taking place in the United Kingdom. “Trenches” rings the bells of anarchy as Wilkinson poetically dictates his rage. Instrumentally nothing beats the last few minutes of “Born To Die” which feels like the climax of a rock orchestra. This is an album that while only containing eight tracks, takes its time to give you the full cover to cover. However Joe Carrol, the saxophonist, is really the person you all came to hear about. He is the torch carrier in this dark quartet's journey into mystery. Their studio sessions consisted of very improvisational recordings mainly supported by Carrol. He is absolutely the backbone behind Maruja’s unique sound. One comparable to a Jackson Pollock painting.

                    After a couple listens I can absolutely attest that this multi-genre fusion album is one for the books. Within the modern punk scene Maruja seems to be on the cusp of mainstream, and while yes I believe they will continue to grow in popularity, I do not expect them to give into the temptations of commercialism. Their powerful hook simply calls the every-man.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Break-beat and saxophone galore, “Pain to Power” by Maruja does an exceptional job at amplifying the art of instrumentals in punk rock. It’s an album I entered with certain expectations, and I came out of the experience with a new look on this British hard punk scene we have seen a rise of in the last half decade.

                <p>
                    The band does a fantastic job of layering their messages throughout the record with tracks like “Bloodsport” and “Look Down On Us” presenting topics in government corruption and high status greed, versus later tracks like “Zaytoun” drawing attention to important contemporary topics such as the Palestinian genocide, calling for hope in a time of anger and grief. The overall attitude revolves around the message of unity, trying to oppose fear of those in power, and rather than just wait around for nothing to happen, take action.

                    Circling back to what I stated earlier, the jewel in the crown in this album is its exciting instrumentals, weighing heavy on the loud “break” drums, and the long saxophone melodies. It adds a flavor to this jazz-fusion punk rock we have rarely seen in the young lifespan of punk. On top of that, it adds a level to the soundscape, making everything feel very chaotic, further supporting the emotions of the record.

                    As for my feelings on today’s pick, I really can’t express enough how much I enjoyed the instumentals Maruja so perfectly laid out in their 8 tracks. The songs not only create an interesting atmosphere for its listeners, but also prioritize contemporary thought through their lyrics, making it clear that actions are louder than words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I have stated in the prior days, “Pain to Power” by Maruja might not be for everyone, but then again, would it be punk rock if it was? It’s a mind bending dive into the ever so popular world of British punk and hard rock, using music as a tool to drive their messages into the hearts of listeners across the world.
