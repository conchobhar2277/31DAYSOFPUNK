                    While they may not have the highest listener count on this list, Lord Friday the 13th are a force to be reckoned with. Defined by their instagram bio as a “dollar store trash-glam-punk-band,” these fab sibling fronted punk rookies from Austin blend humorous lyrics with clad outfits and are quickly making their mark on the scene. Their first album “Promoerotica” released earlier this year and I can say for sure that it is a must listen.

                    Felix and Sloane Lenz have made a debut album capable of being a riot anthem, a nighttime drive listen, and a drag soundtrack. The “trash” in their title clearly refers to their gloom and doom influence, with effect pedals ringing through all 13 tracks. “Glam” refers to their stage presence, which as I hinted at earlier, involves Felix Lenz in full drag, only adding to the punk nature of this band. Heavy hitters from this album include tracks like “Babes In Boyland,” “Auntie American,” and my favorite “Hot For Preacher” (to those who understand the reference) which begins in a completely different language.

                    Above all the heart-thumping energy this album provides its listeners with, it also ignites a hint of FOMO for those who have yet to see them live. This is the LP equivalent of the lights across the lake, forcing you to wonder what kind of party is being held in their home city of Austin. Well we are here to tell you, it's the best one. With the influence of the 80s and the resources of now, Lord Friday the 13th is surely to take over the world.

                <p>
                    Straight from one of my favorite cities in the world, Lord Friday the 13th takes listeners on a joyride through trash-glam-punk, a genre marked by its loyalty to that old punk sound, but with the advantage of modern studio technology, Promoerotica differentiates itself from any The Clash wannabees. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I could relate them to another artist or band, I would, but Lord Friday the 13th clearly doesn’t want to be compared. These two siblings out of Austin Texas are at the forefront of helping bring back trash-glam-punk in the rebellious glory it always had. They combine raw sound with raw energy, and their 2025 release is a dirty slap in the face to conformity under societal pressure. Now as I did my research on the band and Promoerotica, it is clear they bring their vigor with them no matter the scene, making themselves a popular name among underground punk fans, and living up to the “Liza Minneli fronting the Sex Pistols” comparison (compared nonetheless). As far as this album goes, it’s two handfuls of what I feel is an underrated vocal style, where Felix Lenz takes a less common approach, and instead of belting out every lyric, they focus on each word and frame their speech almost like a written letter, making every insult last.

                    Lord Friday the 13th might not be for everybody, but then again would it be punk rock if it was? Promoerotica does a fantastic job on all fronts, and I can only hope that to see them live soon, and experience their notorious underground energy they bring to the stage.
