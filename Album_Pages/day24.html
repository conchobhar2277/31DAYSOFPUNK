                    FUGAZI!! I have been pumped for this day all month. I am a huge Fugazi fan, what a revolutionary band they were. And their chaos came with construction - everything from their production quality to their live presence was seriously unmatched. It is hard to concentrate all this excitement into just one blurb, but I will try my best. The word Fugazi is synonymous with the word nonsense, which is only half the story with this band. If you peer your eyes to some film, you will see the nonsensical, outrageous and vulgar Ian MacKaye belting out his swan song, while Guy Picciotto launches himself around the stage. An emotion-fueled samba one could call it. Now if you guys have been keeping up with the articles this month you would remember that we looked over the legendary hardcore band Minor Threat (See 12/9). Well Ian MacKaye a founding member of that short-lived powerhouse, and after their infinite hiatus abruptly began, he recruited a group of ragtag experimentalists and journeyed on as Fugazi (MacKaye would play in a couple small groups before the band’s inception in 1987 - Embrace). Okay, now that we have some context, here’s the album.

                    13 Songs is one of those mount rushmore albums for punk. It’s just about as important as the genre itself. It fuses reggae, funk and hardcore in a way that makes you forget that they are even separate genres to begin with. Something I find vital in a good albums schedule is the opener, and this one blows it out of the park. “Waiting Room” begins with this beautiful Joe Lally bass run into a duo-chorus-belter of a song. Halfway down the album you find “Glue Man,” which holds one of my favorite riffs in the whole LP. Contrary to the outsiders opinion, the whole thing is not just screaming. There are these poetic verses of almost spoken word lyrics, like in the song “And the Same.” To save the best for last, I want to highlight the drummer, Colin Sears - a master of his craft. Sears is what makes this band's music so dynamic. He holds a groove better than 99% of rock drummers and throughout the album he tosses in his own variety of jazz percussion. The album will take you around these rhythmic escapades and then jolt you with sudden stops and crashes, all supported on the back of Sears - example being “Burning Too.”

                    It would take me hours to go into the full detail as to why I love this band. But for right now you guys have 13 songs. This album is not just a hallmark of rock history, but also one of my all time favorites. On this list I would consider it one of the few no-skip albums. The whole ride will make you wish you could experience it again for the first time. Everybody’s moving, moving, moving, moving - Please don’t leave me to remain. Function is the key. That’s all for Fugazi.

                <p>
                    I want you to think about your favorite hardcore band. Title Fight? Turnstile? Speed? No matter which group, they likely took inspiration from the likes of Ian MacKaye, Guy Picciotto, Brendan Canty, and Joe Lally, who together are known as the legendary <strong>Fugazi</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being no stranger to the genre, nor a stranger to this blog, Ian MacKaye was a punk prophet that ruled the 80s, with his hardcore bands Minor Threat and Embrace setting the stage for the sub-genre and acting as the perfect practice for his post-punk jewel, Fugazi (with full respect to both Minor Threat and Embrace). Not only that, but they broadened the spectrum of what punk rock was and how it was perceived, keeping their “straight edge” social mentality and all age shows, along with expanding from blaring guitars to funky rhythms and reggae influences. It became less centered around screaming into a mic over a dirty drum beat, and more focused on an expertly crafted mix of instrumentals and lyrics. “13 Songs” displays this perfectly, compiled with tracks from their first 2 EPs surrounding numerous topics regarding the AIDS epidemic, sexual harassment, and social limbo. Their ticket prices were around $5-$7 to make it accessible to anyone who wanted to see, and in fact, they were so anti-consumerism they famously didn’t sell any merchandise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it’s not like that mattered, because nobody could pay attention to merch over the infamous live performances Fugazi put on. Thank god these shows were at a time when digital recorders became commercially popular, because we have video evidence of the chaos and the energy that came out of the band, whether that be MacKaye slamming his guitar, or Canty practically breaking his drum sticks, these shows were an incredible sight to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know if I have fallen in love with an album as fast as I did with “13 songs”. It’s not just a continuation of Ian MacKaye's marvelous work, but in my opinion an evolution. From the opening bass line on “Waiting Room” to the crowd favorite “Glue Man”, Fugazi’s biggest strength in my mind is their ability to encapsulate their raw stage energy into a studio recording. I mean it had me banging my head and jumping around my room just as they would the stages of Washington D.C. back in the 90s. It’s truly a one of a kind album that is gonna stick with me for many years, and I strongly recommend listening to it in the best quality you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So that’s Fugazi. They would go on to make 5 more studio albums, leading to an eventual break up in 2003. Whether you enjoyed Minor Threat for its energy, or maybe you yearn for clearer vocals over more diverse musical styles, whatever the case, this LP has got it. I cannot recommend  “13 Songs” more if I tried, and I’d wager a listen through will make a fan out of you as well.
