                    SKA-PUNK! Hands down one of the greatest sub-genres. Ska ties its roots to the Jamaican music we know and love. As reggae stole the ears of the western listener, it began to attract punk bands starting in the early 70’s, even though the style did not become popular until around the mid 90’s. It is not surprising that these groups would work so well together, considering both genres stand for anti-conformism and are often connected to a revolution of some sort. Musically, within reggae you have an off-beat rhythm section, holding against the grain within their instrumentals just as much as their lyrics. Young west coast rockers took this music and added walking bass lines, quick-changing tempos, and most importantly, a horn section. It is not difficult to spot a ska-punk band, as their typical aesthetic is blindingly bright and wacky. Some great bands that embody this beach-filled spirit are No Doubt, Sublime, Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, The Mighty Bosstones, and many more.

                    Today we are going over The Suicide Machines first album “Destruction By Definition” which released in 1996 to a hungry group of fans. With Ska being predominately located on the west coast, this bunch became a staple of Detroit and the midwest as a whole. Destruction By Definition is an angsty, silly power trip wrapped into a tiny city venue. Suicide Machines employ one of the most powerful tools that ska has, harmonizing vocalists. This punk choir only adds texture to their chorus sections. You clearly hear their Detroit hard rock influences with riffs like “Hey” and “Inside/Outside.” This whole album is a benchmark in the late 90’s rock era, and I would be quick to consider it a must listen.

                    If you want a real taste of The Suicide Machines check out some of their live recordings. Long before they had this release they were already notorious for their high octane shows that would leave fans with love and bruises, and the cover photo for this album gives us a glimpse into their orchestrated summer circus. To this day Ska-punk is still a genre that evokes feelings of glee and an untouched excitement - forcing fans bold enough to mosh any chance they get. Take this album and dive into the pit, and to end off this day like The Suicide Machines, “FUCK!”

                    Ska Punk Ska Punk Ska Punk!!!! For a sub-genre so loved and so huge, it’s no wonder it is often classified as its own genre of Rock. If you are unfamiliar with what Ska/Ska-Punk is, it takes the fast rhythms and nature of punk music, and combines it with pop-punk clear tone guitars, and the as for the cherry on top they mix in horns. It’s a vibrant take on punk that originated in Jamaica, progressing throughout the world to eventually become the score of skaters and rebels from the 90s onwards, and I can tell you now that today's album does not disappoint the Ska brand.

                    “Destruction by Definition” was recorded in 1996 by The Suicide Machines, making its mark among the prominent Ska scene at the time including bands like The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, and Less Than Jake (My personal favorite). But what makes The Suicide Machines different is rather then sticking true to the pop-punk roots of Southern California, they integrate their classic hard rock genes from their home town of Detroit, which is very prominent throughout this album. This being the first full length record by the band, its 17 tracks do a fantastic job of highlighting the musical talent among them, with striking drum patterns, guitar riffs, bass lines, and of course the heart of all ska, HORNS. I mean just the trombone in “Vans Song” is enough to introduce someone to the beauty of the sub-genre, creating a unique atmosphere for listeners to experience. If the track titles like “Punk Out”, “Face Values”, and “Insecurities” weren’t clear enough, the general message of the album revolves around breaking out of labels, and finding peace with who you are. They convey this so beautifully in the variation of vocal tone, which I found incredibly impressive, ranging from a raging scream down to a mellow talk, it’s an album filled with clues of what they want the listener to get out of it.

                    If you couldn’t tell from my initial paragraph, I love Ska, and I loved this album. It gives me the same feelings as the two guys on the cover, making me want to jump around and bang my head. I found it so cool how much hard rock influence you can hear in tracks like “Hey” along with their overall vibes being very much rooted in teenage angst and screwing around with your friends. These are vibes that fit the subgenre, but also allowed the album to stick with me personally, making it one of my favorite albums of the month.

                    Given all that has been said, I hope you take the chance to dance to the beat of “Destruction by Definition”, and enjoy what I feel is a great introduction to Ska Punk for those who have never listened, just as much as it is a great album for those who have cherished Ska Punk for years.
