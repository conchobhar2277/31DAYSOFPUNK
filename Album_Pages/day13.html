                    Riot Grrrl bands. A staple of the punk genre, known for their emphasis on feminism within everyday society, politics, and the music industry, shoving the middle finger in the faces of sexism around the globe. On top of that, they RIOT, and that word should not be understated when talking about these bands, as everyone from Destroy Boys to Bratmobile make any stage and studio their opportunity to let you know what’s up. Now as far as the catalog of incredible Riot Grrrl bands go, one must recognize the influence, raw energy, and power of Bikini Kill.

                    We decided to go with their 2014 compilation ‘The First Two Records’, which takes from their 1992 EP ‘Revolution Girl Style Now’ and another half of the EP ‘Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah’. To describe it in one word, “Explosive”. It is a radical combination of nasty guitar hooks and Kathleen Hanna screaming in the faces of those who abuse, label, misogynists, and above all, powerhungry men. The band and their discography kickstarted the Riot Grrrl movement, and whether it’s conveyed through their pre-song conversations, or they straight up tell the audience what they mean, the band doesn’t waste any time confusing listeners, making it harder to obscure or twist their message. With it being a compilation, it gives a good mix of studio tracks, and live tracks, letting the listener experience how electric a show was. This album truly is like listening to history, as it’s the kickstart of one of the most powerful shifts in rock, reconstructing the punk genre as something not just for skaters and skinny men, but rather as a weapon for women to fight back on both social and political grounds, as well as inspire and empower generations of women to riot against a patriarchal society.

                    Now as far as my impressions were, this compilation brings the house down. Just as a punk record in general, it exceeds the bounds of what you expect, making every slam of the guitar emphasize the frustration conveyed in their lyrics. It has genuine screams (not just yelling loud into a microphone, like actual screaming) and the preludes that set up the songs such as in ‘White Boy’ make it so much more fun to listen to, like they are yelling at a physical person or group. And of course how could I not mention the incredible, gnarly, heavy bass lines coming from Kathi Wilcox.

                    It’s a blast from the 90s that started one of the most powerful movements in music, which translated to even louder support from outside the industry. If you want something badass, or you want the perfect introduction to punk’s Queens of anarchy, check out Bikini Kill’s ‘The First Two Records’.
