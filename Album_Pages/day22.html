                <h3>Ben's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    When Connor approached me to do 31 days of punk I knew Black Flag had to be somewhere in the conversation. The band was arguably the most crucial piece in forming what we know as hardcore, a genre defined by incorporating fast punk rhythms with heavy-metal riffs, concocting a tidal wave of energy. Countless bands have followed in the footsteps of these punk-rock gods. Lead vocalist Henry Rollins is one of my all time favorite frontmen and would later run with his own band in the 90s (See - Henry Rollins Band Lollapalooza). By the early 80s this band was already known far and wide within the punk scene, having released multiple EPs as well as their smash hit album “Damaged” in 1981. In 1984 this band released three LPs: “My War” (one of the most successful punk releases ever), Family Man which is all spoken word, and Slip It In - today’s topic of choice.

                    Slip It In truly punches through the roof of label boundaries. Within just the title track you get a good sense at how eldritch and abnormal this album is. Something you may also notice about this song is its opening, sounds familiar right? This is because that drum break was later used in the legendary rock barn burner “Song for the Dead” by Queens of the Stone Age. I see the album as a perfect example of instrumental story telling, something conjured within the progressive rock genre. This “progressive-punk” style they formed allows for Henry Rollins gnarly vocals to be inflected, creating a richer tone and color to this storybook. You hear it in songs like “Rats Eyes” when during the chorus, the guitar+cymbals gives a sort of hiss to compliment Rollins’ sinister delivery. The album illustrates the human experience, mainly through the eyes of delinquency, and in truly the most expressive way possible (it really is hard to overstate). Many of Greg Ginn’s guitar riffs are reminiscent of the thrash-metal genre wiping through earth at that time. It’s not until you reach “Obliteration” that you get the full scope of Ginns’ genius, as he rips through a 6 minute long guitar thesis sure to make you grin.

                    This album, and this band, were truly the first of their kind, and their influence only proves that. All of the albums we have seen this month are top-shelf, but this one might reach a whole new caliber. I hope you like this one as much as I do, and assuming you’re in love, go check out “My War” - From curdling moans to deep guitar madness “Slip It In” is not just a punk masterclass, it is a lecture in musical adaptation.

                <h3>Connor's thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    Possibly the most anticipated album of the month for me, Black Flag’s provocative 1984 album “Slip It In” is as interesting as it is controversial. It offers its blistering impact on hardcore punk, a sound prominent within the LP, along with a fun mix of metal subgenres to keep listeners on their toes. While I am sure everyone has their separate opinions on this album in regards to Black Flag’s discography (or maybe you’re like me and had never listened to a Black Flag album before), I think it’s safe to say it’s hard to come out of this listen uninterested.

                <p>
                    Taking it back to a few days ago (Circle Jerks), Black Flag started as a hardcore band out of Hermosa Beach, California with Keith Morris on vocals and Greg Ginn on guitar. This lineup would be short lived and the band would start to settle into their next era with Henry Rollins at the vocal helm, Kira Roessler at bass, and Bill Stevenson at drums to support their high speed, growly, heavy style of punk.

                    From the beginning, you don’t need to wonder why this album was controversial, especially for '84. Its sexually explicit title track opens the album with ambiguous lyrics having been argued by journals and forums for years. To some, the track is a projection of the band's thoughts on women’s morals, and to some it's just a graphic telling of two people experiencing sex for the first time. Regardless, it creates a jolting listening atmosphere, and sets the listeners expectations for how Black Flag operates as a band, and that is to not have expectations. From there, the rest of the album is just as, if not more fascinating, switching at rapid pace between mosh pit fodder songs like “My Ghetto” and low tunes like “The Bars”. In short, the record is a testament to what punk is, bringing the often gross, uncomfortable, and controversial into conversation, and leaving people interested and sometimes confused, rather than bored and clear.

                    While I can only guess Benjamin spent some time talking about Henry Rollins, I was going into today’s album completely blind, not knowing much about Rollins, or the band. Of course, the more you listen and read about punk rock, the more you are bound to hear about Black Flag, so this was long overdue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for my thoughts, I really want to highlight the heavy heavy heavy nature of this album. It’s not only so fitting for the hardcore style they flaunted, but it allowed Roessler to lay into her bass guitar lines, making every single song feel less static, and gave the band freedom to just go crazy, which I'm sure translated well to their live sets. On top of this, tracks like “Rat’s Eyes” woke me up from the punk trance with its deep vocal range and slow, melodic instrumentals, reminding me of my favorite metal songs.
                </p>

                    With so much weight tied to their name, Black Flag’s “Slip It In” is no ordinary album among their catalog. It brings a captivating and explicit twist to their explosive hardcore punk, that emphasizes why punk is punk. It doesn't try to feed into anyone's expectations, but rather make the listener interested in what they have in store next. I loved it, and I hope you love it.
