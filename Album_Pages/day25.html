                    MERRY CHRISTMAS!! Regardless of whatever/however you celebrate this time of year it is well agreed upon that one of the beneficial outputs of this holiday’s over-commercialism is the music. It seems like everyone has a christmas album, cycling through the same list of standards or potentially risking credibility by writing their own (harder than it seems). Well no matter the case we all have some connection to this time of year, and for Connor and I it seems to be wrapped in our headphones. So, as our gift to y’all, here is a punk rock christmas album.

                    Picture this, it’s Seattle 1992 (the grunge era), the epicenter, no, the mecca of rock at the time. And you are wondering what kind of band to form. Ignoring the mainstream you form a punk band. This is the short rendition of the MxPx, or Magnified Plaid story. These cats became legends of the pacific northwest, running with the bulls of punk at the time. Multiple Studio albums and compilations later these guys have certainly reached greatness, and today we are covering just one of their 4 EPs.

                    Punk Rawk Christmas is a heavy handed look at an early 2000s Christmas. From the glee of a snow-ball fight, to the financial struggles that can come with the season this album brings a more nuanced and real look at the acclaimed holiday. However the LP is not without its silliness. Songs like “Late Great Snowball Fight of 2006” act as a rambunctious intermission in what I would sympathetically call a gloomy album. This album has quickly become an every season listen for me personally. Just a footnote in the larger than life tenure of MxPx. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

                    Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! Benjamin and I felt that in the spirit of the season, we should find a great punk rock Christmas record for the day, and to our surprise, the incredible MxPx has a 6 song EP to bring good tidings to your ears!

                    Putting the bells and cheer aside, it’s only right we talk about the true meaning (history) of MxPx. Roaring out of Washington state at the ages of 15, this pop punk trio took inspiration from punk greats such as Black Flag and The Descendents, blending it with classy punk chords and pop vocals to form their own dent on the subgenre. The group would record several studio albums and go through minor changes over the span of 30 years, rocking the small venues of the pacific northwest, to backing blink-182 at the Vans Warped Tour. While the band does not label themselves as a particularly religious band, their early albums were geared toward their Christian roots, landing them a number 1 spot on the Christian Rock billboard in 2000. That being said, their music is not just for the religious, but meant to be enjoyed by everybody, hence their distance from the “Christian” label and their later albums being less geared toward the faith.

                    Now back on track with their 2018 EP, “Punk Rawk Christmas”, MxPx seemed to have a fun time compiling this over the years. I say that as it was in fact not recorded all at once, but actually a compilation of Christmas songs they had written and recorded from the years 1998-2008. This would be originally released in 2009 as a 10 track album, but with the edition of the song “December” in 2018, they would pull the original LP from all platforms, and replace it with a shortened EP. Regardless, in their instruments, and in the voice of Mike Herrera, you hear the upbeat vocal tones of pop punk mixed with cheery bass lines and speedy drum kicks. Their songs are filled with catchy lyrics about snowball fights, parties, and leaving the stress of the season behind. It’s a fun way to bring in the holiday, and a little break from listening to the same Christmas tunes scattered across different artists (Not saying I don’t enjoy “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” and all of its renditions).

                    So spin this quick track, and ring in some fun this season, reminding yourself that through all the stress of family, gift shopping, and dinner preparations, that it’s okay to take a break, and enjoy the moments with your loved ones while dancing to the sweet hooks of MxPx.
