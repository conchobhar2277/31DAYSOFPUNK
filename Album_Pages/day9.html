                   The all-powerful Minor Threat only released two albums and a couple EPs, making them one of the smallest discographies on this list. This album, “First Two Seven Inches” is a compilation album released in 1984. An A+ report of the band's short career. Similar to this band's punk brothers and sisters, there is never a point where vocalist Ian Mackaye lowers past his decibel level. The band backing him returns this powerful energy by ripping apart their instruments every night. While these heathens never played in a room above 500 people, their legacy has hit thousands. 
                    Some of the standout tracks from this album include “ Straight Edge,” “In My Eyes,” and their title track “Minor Threat.” All of which are tunes laced in political, emotional, and violent lyrics. The song I really want to highlight is Steppin’ Stone, which appears as an original on this album. The song is a perfect example of what intentional mixing looks like. The song begins very Lo-Fi, and as it progresses it crescendos into its booming high fidelity that we have gotten used to. This effect makes you feel as though you are standing outside a club, and as the crowd bursts into a mosh pit you enter, witnessing the full force of these punk behemoths.

                    As mentioned previously, the impressive legacy of this band cannot be overstated. Countless of your favorite rock bands take direct inspiration from Minor Threat. Foo Fighters have recorded a great cover of their song “I Don’t Wanna Hear It.” And with all those musicians coming from the city punk scene of the 80’s, it is no wonder that they praise such legends. When listening to this record you might think to yourself “wow, these guys sound a lot like a band I know.” Yes, your intuition was correct. The rock band who made tidal waves this year, Turnstile, share a similar sound and cadence, about 40 years apart. This is also unsurprising as Minor Threat was from D.C. and Turnstile calls Baltimore, a city just a few miles down the road, their home. But whether you like them because of their sound, their in your face energy, or their uncensored messaging, Minor Threat was the candle in the wind that we wish would ignite again.
