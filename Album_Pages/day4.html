                    With only a few releases over their 30 year 
                    history Fenix TX might not have the biggest 
                    glove but they do pack a heavy punch. Their 
                    self titled debut album is a masterclass in 
                    the stylings of late 90s pop-punk. This band 
                    stands to represent the home city of Connor 
                    and I - Houston, Texas. What many may not 
                    know about this bayou city is that apart 
                    from its popularity in the genres of R&B, 
                    country and hip-hop, we actually have a 
                    pretty great punk scene. I would argue that 
                    as punk music for years has been sought 
                    after in the northeast, midwest and west 
                    coast of the United States, the need for a 
                    punk scene is that much more vital in cities 
                    like Houston. 
                </p>

                    Fenix TX perfectly executes the fast-paced, 
                    high octane rhythms of the pop-punk genre, 
                    while including their own humorous outtakes 
                    into the lyrics. Examples of this include 
                    quoting Judas Priest in the song “G.B.O.H.” 
                    and my personal highlight of the album being 
                    the revamping of the lyrics to the safety 
                    dance in the bridge of “Apple Pie Cowboy 
                    Toothpaste.” And while some might put this 
                    album off as a hodgepodge of pop-punk buzz, 
                    it is actually a well coordinated album. 
                    There is strong continuity between tracks 
                    musically and lyrically, including consistent 
                    references to a character named  “Jolly Green.” 
                    So while Fenix TX may not have put out a 
                    lot of music, what is out there is very well 
                    thought out.

                    This band, like other punk bands in the south, 
                    teaches us that the music we love can be 
                    accessible anywhere, not just in its 
                    birth city. If you want to hear more live punk, 
                    I guarantee it is around you, you just have to 
                    look closer.

                    Before having to change their name 
                    due to a cease and desist from the actor, 
                    <strong>Riverfenix TX</strong> operated in a city known not 
                    for its punk scene, but rather for Rap, Hip Hop, 
                    R&B, and Country.

                    Houston Texas has been our home for a 
                    little over half my life, and there is 
                    possibly no greater pride I get than listening 
                    to the incredibly talented artists it produces. 
                    From ZZ Top to the Geto Boys, Fenix TX fits right 
                    into the niche the city needed in the late 90s, 
                    and their debut album came at a time where skate 
                    and pop-punk was more popular than ever.

                    Heard in their fast riffs and less than 
                    sultry voiced lead singer, this album takes listeners 
                    surfing (pun intended) through a sea of themes, 
                    spanning anywhere between a deceiving partner 
                    and the fallout due to a lack of trust, to a 
                    song about “roosters”. It doesn’t intend to 
                    follow any rules on what the album should be 
                    or how it should be perceived, that being 
                    political vs. serious vs. silly, but rather 
                    it's just a bunch of dudes having fun and 
                    playing fast. This is very apparent
                    in their writing as much as their 
                    playing, using immature terms and 
                    references to other areas of music in order to
                    ultimatley talk about a variety of different pressures
                    the average person experiences. It's dissapointing that the band
                    has so few albums in their 30 year history, but 
                    to be fair, sometimes that perfect debut is all you need
                    to make your mark on the genre.

                    Personally, I could listen to this album 
                    over and over. The bass riff at the beginning 
                    of No Lie is my second favorite bass line of 
                    all time (The first coming up on the 19th of 
                    the month), i’m a sucker for a whiney voice 
                    over a speedy guitar, and just as I mentioned 
                    earlier, this album gives me so much pride in 
                    my city, so I can jam out and feel a greater 
                    connection to a band for simply living down 
                    the road. 
                </p>

                    So as far as your large personal 
                    collection of pop-punk records go, 
                    I think it’s vital to have this one up on 
                    the shelf, and just as Benjamin said, 
                    any music scene is anywhere, you 
                    just might have to look a little deeper.
