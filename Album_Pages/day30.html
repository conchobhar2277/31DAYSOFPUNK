                    Audiotree live functions similar to that of NPR’s tiny desk (or frankly any public broadcast studio), and has hosted many incredible artists over the years. These performances often allow musicians a better oppurtunity to show off their musical talent, focusing less on the grand performance and more on their raw ability, to which the four members of the legendary Mannequin Pussy use to their advantage.

                    As I stated before, these live recordings often don’t show the full scope of the band, given they don’t have the same production value nor live audience to perform for as they would a festival or venue. However, Mannequin Pussy being the Philadelphia badasses they are, are able to encapsulate their infamous live energy onto a platform not necessarily built for it. It’s prominent in the sweet tones of their guitars and the roaring screams of Marisa “Milly” Dabice as they perform a ten track session filled with fan favorites like “Romantic” and “Kiss”. Now, putting this performance aside, Mannequin Pussy is a rising star in the punk genre, blending their alternative style with an incredible vocal range that spans from a whisper to a scream, all while putting on one of the best acts of modern day rock. As the New York Times said, they specialize in “Confrontational” punk, pulling no punches when it comes to their stance on political and sexual freedom along with many other subjects. Overall, the band is a unique act that transcends the expectations of modern punk, and that very trait is what makes them so punk.

                    I am so happy we decided to do this performance. Just as I talked about yesterday, I love live performances as they produce raw vocals that studio recordings often don't capture due to their "perfections". As well, Benjamin and I really like the intimate nature of this as you commonly see with public broadcast channels like NPR. As a product of that environment, every track is almost amplified, and with no distractions from the crowd, they really just let loose without interruption. In short, their short 10 track performance brings the raw energy of their high octane style, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.

                    Go give Mannequin Pussy’s Audiotree live performance a listen, and experience what modern punk is all about, that being fresh, interesting, and of course, rebellious as all hell.
